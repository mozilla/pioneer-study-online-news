        This rating is based on a measure of “ideological alignment” from an academic study -
        <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6239/1130" target="_blank"> Bakshy,
        Messing, and Adamic (2015)</a>. This measure averages the self-reported ideology (where -2
        is very liberal and 2 is very conservative) of users who shared an article from this source
        on a major social media website. “Alignment” is not a measure of media slant; rather, it
        captures differences in the kind of content shared among a set of partisans, which can
        include topic matter, framing, and slant.
